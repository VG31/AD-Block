# AD-Block

**What is Pi-Hole?**

_Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. When Pi-hole is installed, and your computers and devices are configured to use it for their DNS queries, ads and malware are blocked automatically to reduce the chances of being tracked, or having malware installed. This increases both security and privacy on your network overall._

**Importance of Pi-Hole:-**

_1)Ad Blocking: Pi-hole blocks ads at the network level before they reach your devices, leading to a smoother and faster browsing experience without the interruption of ads. This is particularly beneficial for devices like smart TVs, smartphones, and IoT devices that might not support traditional ad-blocking extensions or software._

_2)Privacy: By blocking ad trackers and other malicious domains, Pi-hole helps protect your privacy by preventing these domains from collecting data about your browsing habits and behavior. This reduces the risk of being tracked across different websites and enhances online privacy._

_3)Security: Pi-hole blocks access to known malicious domains, protecting your devices from accessing potentially harmful content such as malware, phishing sites, and other online threats. It acts as an additional layer of defense alongside antivirus software and firewalls._

**Requirements:-**

_1)Raspberry Pi (Any Model)_

_2)SS Card_

_3)Raspberry Pi Imager_

_4)Need to have an Ethernet Connection._
